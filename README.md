Qualitative research involves the collection and analysis of textual data, such as interview transcripts, open-ended survey responses, and field notes. It is often used in social sciences, humanities, and health research to explore complex phenomena and understand human experiences. In addition to textual data, qualitative researchers may also collect quantitative data, such as survey responses or demographic information, to complement their qualitative findings.

Qualitative research is often characterized by its inductive approach, where researchers aim to generate theories or concepts from the data rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses. This process is known as Grounded Theory, which emphasizes the importance of data-driven analysis and theory development.

We are developing a framework that integrates **textual data** (as a list of documents) and **numeric data** (as Pandas DataFrame) into structured classes that retain **metadata** from various analytical processes, such as **topic modeling** and **decision trees**. Researchers, with or without GenAI assistance, can define relationships between textual and numerical datasets based on their chosen **theoretical lens**.  A final analytical phase ensures that proposed relationships actually hold true.

## Example use

A company collects:
- **Textual** feedback from customer support interactions.
- **Numerical** data on customer retention and sales performance.
Using this framework, business analysts can investigate how recurring concerns in feedback correspond to measurable business outcomes.
